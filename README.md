## ðŸš€ How It Works

- Uses the `turtle` module to draw rows of evenly spaced colored dots
- Uses the `colorgram` library (optional) to extract colors from an image
- Can be fully customized in terms of:
  - Number of dots
  - Grid size
  - Dot spacing
  - Colors used

## ðŸ§° Requirements

### Standard (no external colors):
```bash
python3 hirst_painting.py
If using colorgram.py to extract colors:
bash
Copy code
pip install colorgram.py
